# 1. Build the dependencies
# 2. Build the application

# This way, each stage is cached and rebuilding the application is faster.


# Stage 1: Build the dependencies

# Copy the installed application from the build image to the smaller image.

# Then we use a small base image and copy the compiled application into this image. This way we get a small image without overheating the build environment.
